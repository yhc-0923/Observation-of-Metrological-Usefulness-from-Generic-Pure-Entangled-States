# Observation of Metrological Usefulness from Generic Pure Entangled States
This repository contains the code and data for the paper "Observation of Metrological Usefulness from Generic Pure Entangled States". The code is designed to analyze experimental quantum metrology data, focusing on the metrological properties of entangled states. The analysis pipeline processes raw experimental data, performs statistical analysis, calculates Fisher information, and generates figures for publication.

# Requirements
The code is written in Python 3 and requires the following packages: 
 - numpy
 - sympy
 - scipy
 - pandas
 - pickle

# Code Description

## Main Files
 -  main.py: he main script for data analysis. This file orchestrates the entire analysis pipeline, from loading raw data to generating final results.
 -  drawfig.py: Contains functions for generating the figures presented in the main text of the paper. These functions are called by main.py to produce publication-ready plots.
 -  theory/: Folder containing theoretical simulation results. These are used for comparison with experimental data and validation of the analysis methods.

## Data Folders
 -  rawdata/: Folder containing the unprocessed experimental raw data. The data is organized by experimental runs and includes all measurement outcomes.
 -  figures/: Folder where the figures generated by the code are saved. Both main text figures and supplementary figures are stored here.

## Function Overview
 - cal_p: Computes frequency distributions and their statistical properties from the raw measurement data. 
 - cal_delta: Performs maximum likelihood estimation to extract optimal parameters and calculates the variance of the estimates. 
 - f_minimize: A custom function for manually fitting probability density functions when scipy's built-in optimizers perform poorly. This provides more control over the fitting process and ensures robust results.
 - cal_FI: Calculating the classical fisher information from the fitting probability density functions.
 - cal_singularity: Shearching for the singularities.
 - data_analysis: The main function that orchestrates the analysis pipeline. 

# How to Use
1. Set up the environment: Ensure all required packages are installed. 
2. Prepare the data: Unzip rawdata.zip to place experimental raw data in the rawdata/ folder with the expected naming convention.
3. Run the analysis: Execute main.py to perform the data analysis and generate figures. The script will:
 - Load and preprocess raw data
 - Perform statistical analysis
 - Calculate Fisher information
 - Generate figures
 - Save results to appropriate folders
